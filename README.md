gl-pyramids
===========

A WebGL demo illustrating the use of render-to-texture, blur, and glow shaders in emulating 80s-esque vector graphics.

The shaders should all be considered part of the public domain. Those files in the support directory all have their own licensing terms. The rest of the project is all BSD.
